- Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Java, C++

## <span style="color: #4287f5;">Interests</span>
In my spare time, my friends and I often solve problems on LeetCode, which trains our logical thinking and enhances the flexibility of applying programming syntax. 
In addition, I enjoy playing basketball and going mountain climbing with my friends.
